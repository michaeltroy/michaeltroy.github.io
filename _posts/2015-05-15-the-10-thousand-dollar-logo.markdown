It’s kinda odd the things that pop into your head at 2am on a Tuesday morning while trying to sleep. This time it was why I’d never design a logo for less than $5,000. Yeah I know, a fairly random thought. Anyways, why the number $5,000? I reasoned it simply wasn’t worth the effort I'd want to invest in such a project. I’m talking proper logo design development, you know the kind of design work that is accompanied with usage guidelines and variations. It just didn’t reconcile.

I held that $5,000 number in my mind for a brief moment, only to bump the figure to $10,000. Yeah, that felt about right to me.

I can hear the gasps “Whoa, 10 thousand is ridiculous”. OK, sure I understand that but I’ll put it this way, I can guarantee with 100% certainty there are many designers out there that would be inversely horrified and would say that $10,000 isn’t nearly enough. Fair I say.

<p class="break break-subhead">Let’s take a look at the 3 reasons that helped me arrive at $10,000</p>

<p class="subhead purple-light">One. Any less and it wasn’t worth the effort I was willing to invest.</p>

The most I’d ever charged was $1200. And at the time I thought that was good. I was wrong. Effort and investment and loosely coupled things. However, in my mind they both add up to value.

<br />

<p class="subhead purple-light">Two. I simply placed a higher value on such work</p>

Value is a funny thing. Something of value to one person almost never has the same value to another. So start with your value. Is this throw-away work, or does it mean something more to you?

How do I value such design work? Good design work. Well I don’t value a logo at $300 which by some strange reasoning seems to be the market rate for such work. When you pay $300 for a logo, more often than not you’ll be delivered a piece of <s>shit</s> design that is ill-considered, not resolved and has no thought for the broader brand you’re communicating.

<span class="highlight">The client I want is not the client that pays $300 for a logo.</span>

The client that pays me $10,000 for a logo values her business. And I value her business.

<br />

<p class="subhead purple-light">Three. The $10,000 number just felt right. Full stop.</p>

The number just felt right and that is OK. There is nothing wrong with coming up with a nice round figure for no other reason that it’s the amount you want to charge. Forget people that say “Oh, but I could get that done for $300”. Forget them. If you want to charge $2000, fine, do that. See reason 2.

<br />

So there you have it. Three reasons why I wouldn’t charge less than $10,000 for a logo. I’ll leave you with one last thought:

Price is a device used for market differentiation. A good whole round number speaks volumes to a serious customer. It says “Approach me if you’re serious, because I’m serious too.”

<br />

What are your thoughts? How much would you charge?

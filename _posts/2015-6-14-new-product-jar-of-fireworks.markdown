I’ve just launched a new product. It’s called [Jar of Fireworks](http://jaroffireworks.com) and it’s a productized consulting service. Yeah, what a mouth full huh. In plain english it just means I’ve packaged-up some of my time along with managing an [A/B testing tool](https://vwo.com) to run design experiments.

<br />

The product offering is simple; for $690 each month you get an hour of my time to discuss design and any goals you have with your website, like increasing signups. I also setup and run three A/B tests that align with your goal. Each test comes with a report card at the end. The report card includes actionable next steps based on the results of the tests. That’s it. Very focused, no fluff.

<br />

I’m really excited about the simplicity of this product.

At some point a few years back — I can’t say exactly when — I started to think about taking advantage of the low-hanging fruit on some of my client’s websites I was managing. You know, take an established website, app or other digital product, identify some element of the design, make a small change and reap big rewards. That was the theory anyways. It fascinated me. Did I do anything about this? No, it remained just an idea.

Fast-forward to about one month ago. It was a Saturday afternoon and I’d stumbled across [Brennan Dunn’s](https://twitter.com/brennandunn) website [Double Your Freelancing](http://doubleyourfreelancing.com). I bounced around the site for a few minutes and then I read [this post](http://doubleyourfreelancing.com/how-to-start-selling-retainers-for-your-freelance-consulting-business/) and it completely challenged me to revisit my low-hanging fruit thinking and do something about it.

That post was about a guy called [Nick Disabato](https://twitter.com/nickd). Nick created a product called Draft Revise. Nick’s product is a high-touch productized consulting service just like Jar of Fireworks. I was really inspired by this idea and thought it was a perfect starting point to do something similar. I reached out to Nick to get his blessing. He said go for it.

There is no business plan for Jar of Fireworks. That’s perfectly fine with me. I’m leaving things open. I want to see what happens next. I’m keen to see how the product is received and will I be able to find product market fit. I plan on tweaking, editing and testing the product over time and sharing what I’ve learned along the way. Mostly, I’m looking forward to delivering the best possibly customer service that I can.

<br />

<span class="highlight">Currently I’m limiting the service to <strong>four</strong> customers.</span>

I may expand the product offering to more customers in the future, though for now it’s all about delivering a first-class product to a few customers.

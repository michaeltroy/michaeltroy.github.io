It’s kinda odd the things that pop into your head at 2am on a Thursday morning, while trying to sleep. This time it was why I’d never design a logo for less than $5,000. I reasoned it simply wasn’t worth the effort I would want to invest in such a project. It didn’t reconcile. I held that thought for a brief moment, then I bumped that figure to $10,000. Yeah, that felt about right to me.

There are 3 reasons I arrived at that number.

1. Wasn’t worth the effort I was willing to invest
2. I simply placed a higher value on such work.
3. the number felt right.

You see there are a couple of reasons for this. Never mind my past mistakes around costing design work. The most i’d ever charged was $1200. And I though that was good. I was so very wrong.

I can hear the gasps “Whoa, 10 thousand is ridiculous”. Well I’ll put it this way, I’m certain there will be a few designers that will say that that isn’t nearly enough. Fair I say.

So how did arrive at this figure? In my mind its simple really. It comes down to value. How do I value such design work. Good design work. Well I don’t value it at $300 which by some strange thinking and apparent self-correcting market price seems to be rate for such work.

<span class="highlight">The client I want is not the client that pays $300 for a logo.</span>

The client that pays me $10k for a logo values her business. And I value her business.

When you pay $300 for a logo, more often than not you’ll be delivered a piece of design that is ill considered, not resolved and has no thought for the broader brand you’re communicating.

10k is a good market differentiator. It says “approach me if you’re serious, because I’m serious too.”

A blank canvas is full of promise, an open plain waiting in lay for us to cast upon it our infinite depth of creativity. Except it isn’t. Not really.

Many years ago I was due to exhibit some graphic design work. The deadline was just two days away and I had nothing ready. Nothing to exhibit. I was not having fun.

That night, two days before the show, inspiration arrived. At a very inconvenient time -- 3am. Typical. But hurrah, I’d thought up a solution. I felt lighter.

<br />

<span class="purple-light">The idea was this:</span> I’d create a blank canvas in Photoshop measuring 100cm x 100cm. I would then open a web browser and start copy and pasting images from a Google image search right onto that Photoshop canvas. I’d do this five times in total -- five pieces of work to exhibit.

The idea that I was about to explore — in two days — was by copy and pasting images I'd found in the search results, I was creating something new, by taking and using many existing elements. In a sense I was appropriating. Then with this new ensemble of images, could I arrange them in such a way that by the audience’s definition be judged terrible pieces of graphic art? As a professional graphic designer could I regress in the practice of my craft?

<br />

<span class="highlight">The title of the work was __Appropriation and regression: Heaps crap graphics__.</span>

<br />

__By the constraint of time__ I was able to produce a series of work that was, if not far from being displayed at [MoMA](http://www.moma.org), at least creative.

I made it. A full day before the exhibition deadline. I'd managed to design, have printed and install five prints for my exhibition. The work received positive reviews. Far beyond my expectations.

<p class="break break-subhead">The 1-2-3 design rule to make anyone an instant designer</p>

<br />

Anyone can better their design skills. I really believe that. I’m not talking about becoming the next [Stefan Sagmeister](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Sagmeister), rather this is about feeling more confident the next time you’re putting together a presentation or formatting a document.

During my years as a designer I’ve given the same advice to plenty of non-designers that could use some simple design guidance; the 1-2-3 rule.

<br />

<span class="highlight">One font. Two colors. Three font sizes.</span>

<br />

The 1-2-3 rule is easy to remember and simple to use. Anyone can apply this method in any context, whether its a messy PowerPoint presentation or that boring Word document.

<br />

<p class="subhead purple-light">1. One font.</p>

Start with one font. Whatever the font choice is it almost doesn’t matter*. If you want to play it safe then stick with the classics, Helvetica, Arial or Times New Roman. The goal here isn’t about becoming a world expert typographer, the goal is to make that Word document or email more visually coherent and easier to read.

*Except Comic Sans, don’t go there.

<br />

<p class="subhead purple-light">2. Two colors.</p>

Choose two colors. One of the colours will more than likely be black^ for setting your main body copy. Choose another color like blue, green or purple to add contrast. Apply the second color to your heading levels.

^For the sake of the 1-2-3 rule black is a colour.

<br />

<p class="subhead purple-light">3. Three font sizes.</p>

Use three font sizes, for example 12pt, 18pt and 36pt. In this example use 12pt for copy, 18pt for sub-headings and 36pt once as the main document heading.

<br />

If these rules sound simple, yeah they are. The real trick is to stick to them. You may be tempted to add an extra colour or font. Don’t, just keep it simple. You’ll be amazed at how working with only a few variables can make even the messiest document feel tight.

I’d encourage you to try this out the next time you’re tasked with formatting that Word document or pulling together a presentation.

<br />

I’d love to hear if 1-2-3 rule worked for you. How did you go?

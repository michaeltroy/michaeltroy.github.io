title:  "Naming a startup"

I’ve done a lot of thinking and work around the naming of startups and projects lately. There seems to be a lot of stale advice out there around this subject. Naming a startup in 2015 is a different game than it was in 2010, let alone way-back-when, around the year 2000.

<br />

In short, the general advice seems to be that a good name be no more than two syllables, which is harder to come up with than it sounds. Also given all single dictionary word dot com domains are mostly unavailable, and that any combination of words adding-up to only two syllables seems to be harder to discover by the day.

If you can’t manage that, not to worry, just slap “ly” on the end and everything is sunshine and rainbows. Actually, I’d really encourage anyone that was honestly contemplating the ly approach to be a bit more creative. You really can do it. As hard of a task naming is, put in that extra effort. It’ll be worth it. I promise.

Have I mentioned trademark law yet?

Over the past couple of months I’ve been throwing around an idea I have for a startup. Yeah, of course I think it’s an incredible idea full of potential. Absolutely I do, just like everyone else. I do realize my failings here, thankfully. The reality is ideas are worthless without action.

Back to naming. Enter the word “haunt”. You know, that plain old dictionary word — haunt. This was the perfect name that I’d come up with for my fictional startup. One syllable. Short and sweet. Also I managed to obtain ownership of haunt.co, lovely! My startup would be firmly placed in the travel space, so haunt for me, was an excellent name that had a lot of brand potential.

Not so fast. I performed a trademark search _after_ I had thrown  down a small sum to acquire this spooky domain name. Yeah, after. Make sure you do a search before anything else.

When I did get around to performing a search at the [United States Patent and Trademark Office](http://www.uspto.gov) website, all my hopes and dreams of using haunt as my magical startup name vanished. There it was — Microsoft had actually trademarked the word haunt. Oh man, WTF! A dictionary word too. The icing on the cake was that it had been trademarked in class 9. Software belongs in class 9.

<br />

Scrap. That. Name.

<br />

Back to the drawing board I went. I created a new spreadsheet and quickly came up with about 200 name ideas with varying combinations. Something just was’t working. I was stuck clinging to all the recent advice I’d been reading about naming.

In an effort to shake my thinking I went to Amazon in search of any books I could find around the subject of brand development and product naming. Not startup specific naming. I was in luck, I came across [Hello, My Name is Awesome](http://www.amazon.com/Hello-My-Name-Is-Awesome/dp/1626561869) by Alexandra Watkins of [Eat my words](http://eatmywords.com). I was skeptical at first and headed into the reviews. The reviews were positive so I decided to purchase a copy for Kindle. It was worth it.

Alexandra uses the SMILE and SCRATCH methods. You can read more about [Alexandra’s method](http://eatmywords.com/tips/is-your-name-lame/) on her blog.

For a quick taste of Alexandra’s SCRATCH method, the S stands for Spelling challenged. Flickr, for example, is a spelling challenged name. Yes it worked for Flickr, that doesn’t mean it will work for you. Chances are it won’t. Interestingly, once I stopped worrying about the number of syllables contained in the name ideas I came up with and many other nonsensical rules, my names were not spelling challenged. Hurrah!

Alexandra’s book Hello, my Name is Awesome really encouraged my thinking to escape the tired old advice out there and provided me with some new ideas for brainstorming and a couple of techniques that just work.

I admit that I still haven’t found the perfect startup name for my Billion Dollar Idea™, I’m still brainstorming. However, in my effort to come up with the perfect startup name, I’ve learnt a lot along the way. I’ve also come up with a good name for my new blog — Michael in Beta — which I’m really happy with.

How did you come up with your startup name?

Little Computer People was one of my favourite games when I was a kid. Probably only because I found it in a bargain-bin which meant it was the only game that was legit. I loved my Commodore 64 with cassette deck. It was magic.

At some point growing up napsacks became the cool thing, even better was if you had your named designed in big bold hand-lettering on the back. I was good at hand-lettering. I made a few dollars.

It's funny how if you look at your childhood you'll see where your talents and passions are.

My father is a printer by trade. In my late teens my parents went into the printing business. I learnt design basics and software like Photoshop and QuarkExpress. I also uploaded my first webpage via FTP.

Sometime after moving on from the family business I re-discovered web design. And that was it. A couple of year later I dropped print design completly.

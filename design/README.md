#### A tiny build

Tired of dealing with a front-end mess for tiny websites or prototyping? Tiny Build aims to solve that problem. Tiny Build does three things:

- Uses [Duo](http://duojs.org/) for package management.
- Uses NPM to run the build.
- Compiles JSX (React) to native javascript.

**Tiny!**

Usage ```npm run boot```

##### Bonus points
You'll need a server, I recommend [http-server](https://www.npmjs.org/package/http-server) for a lightweight easy to get-going http-server.
